# Notice! Do not place your custom translation files here.

WPCstore will look in this directory for translations as a fallback. It is however recommended that you use the global WordPress language directory and install your translations like so: `/wp-content/languages/themes/wpcstore-it_IT.mo`. That way they will not be lost or overwritten during WPCstore updates.

Alternatively you can put translations in your child theme: `/wp-content/themes/your-child-theme/languages/it_IT.mo`.

You can read more about installing WPCstore in your language [here](http://docs.woocommerce.com/document/installing-wpcstore-in-your-language/).
